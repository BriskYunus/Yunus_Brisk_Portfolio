# WORKSOFBRISK PORTFOLIO
## Brisk Yunus
### Final Intergrated Assignment - 2019

##### This is my Portfolio page for my wesbite "WORKSOFBRISK"

##### The page is a one pager site, where there are the different sections in the nav bar. The first is the "About" page where you can learn about my life such as my birthplace and my history with Design and Production. The main section is the "Portfolio" page, which includes all my work such as: Photography, Image Designs, Cover Arts and Demo Reel.

##### You can also visit the Contact Form at the bottom where contacts can be made. Currently a simple page that opens a "404" error that let's the user know that it is not fully completed and set up for contacting.
